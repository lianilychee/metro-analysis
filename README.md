# metro-analysis
Fall 2016 Discrete final project.  Analysis of shortest-path algorithms on cities' public transit systems.


* **annotating_help.ipynb:** Jupyter notebook with examples that demonstrate confusing pieces of the NetworkX code

* **dijkstras_annotated.py:** The main annotated code for Dijkstra's. Python file with comments. Double comments (##) are things that we have written and single comments with NX (# NX: ) are comments that came with the NetworkX package. When it refers to examples, it is talking about examples in **annotating_help.ipynb**. 

* **networkx_astar.py:** Code taken directly from NetworkX. Simplified from **networkx_weighted.py** to include only A*.

* **networkx_dijkstras.py:** Code taken directly from NetworkX. Simplified from **networkx_weighted.py** to include only Dijkstra's.

* **networkx_weighted.py:** The exact code from NetworkX containing A* and Dijkstra's implementations.

NetworkX code does not belong to us. It is included in this repo for the purposes of annotating and demonstrating our understanding of the code only. Learn more about [NetworkX here](http://networkx.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
